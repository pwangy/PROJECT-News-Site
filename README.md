# News Site - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.

Create a classic magazine or newspaper site. 

Learning objectives:
  1. Layout webpages using flexbox.
  2. Structure webpages using the box model.
  3. Create a responsive webpage for mobile, desktop, and tablet.


## Approach
After reviewing the provided "Tech to Learn" materials, I decided to build my site following the basic structure from the Code Along (Noops Clone). I picked a subject for my periodical and dived in!

If I had more time, I would change the 10 cloud type cards to have them flip over with the name of each type so they could be used like flash cards.
