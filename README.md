# News Site - Overview
Week 2 project for Technigo 24 week bootcamp.

Create a classic magazine or newspaper site. 

Learning objectives:
  1. Layout webpages using flexbox.
  2. Structure webpages using the box model.
  3. Create a responsive webpage for mobile, desktop, and tablet.


## Approach
I chose information from the International Cloud Atlas and cloud watching as the theme of my news/periodical site. The code along for this week left me with a healthy head start on this project so I continued on with styling, playing with flexbox and populating my cloud cards with information. 

If I had more time, I would change the 10 cloud type cards to have them flip over with the name of each type so they could be used like flash cards.
